# Environment Monitoring IoT Project

This project is an Environment Monitoring System using IoT technology. The system is designed to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and more. The data collected by the sensors is sent to the cloud for storage and analysis.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters
- Data storage and visualization on the cloud
- Alerts and notifications for critical conditions
- Easy to set up and configure

## Components

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi)
- Sensors (e.g., DHT11/DHT22 for temperature and humidity, MQ135 for air quality)
- Wi-Fi module for internet connectivity
- Cloud service for data storage and visualization (e.g., Ubidots)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:**
    - Connect the sensors to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram.
    - Ensure the Wi-Fi module is connected and configured for internet access.

2. **Software Setup:**
    - Install the necessary libraries for the sensors and Wi-Fi module.
    - Write the code to read data from the sensors and send it to the cloud.
    - Upload the code to the microcontroller.

3. **Cloud Setup:**
    - Create an account on Ubidots (or any other cloud service of your choice).
    - Create a new device and configure the data sources.
    - Obtain the API key and device ID for your project.

## Usage

- Power on the system and ensure it is connected to the internet.
- The system will start collecting data from the sensors and send it to the cloud.
- Use the cloud dashboard to visualize the data and set up alerts.
